        <h1>JSRender</h1>
        <p>
          JSRender is my attempt at a custom built render-engine.  It's built on top of the HTML5 Canvas 
          and it renders a 3D textured cube on the screen.

        <h3>
          The basics
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is a rather small demo I created of a simplified solar system, consisting of the Sun and
          eight surrounding planets.

          What really pleased me is that Three.js managed all the scene complexity for me: adding and assigning VBOs, IBOs, buffers, etc, was hidden behind an elegant system of scene, camera, geometry and material management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which fitted me perfectly, because for I long time I wanted to explore shaders in depth, but without the hassle of setting up the traditional OpenGL or WebGL environment. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Shaders
        </h3>
        <p>
          For this example I created two custom shader pairs (vertex and fragment), besides the one thas
          come with Three.js. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The first vertex shader is a very simple one that does the basic <i>gl_Position</i> calculation and then passes that info the fragment shader. This in turn calculates a very simple point light (very little ambient color, diffuse with no attenuation, and no specilar component ) to give the planets a shadow / dark side when not facing the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second pair of shaders act as a post-processing step of sorts, performing a horizontal and then vertical blur on the scene, to give the planets and sun a "blurry edge".
