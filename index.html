          JSRender is my attempt at a custom built sowtware rendering engine.  
          It's built on top of the HTML5 Canvas and it renders a 3D textured and shaded cube on the screen.

          You can use the following keys to move the cube:
          <ul>
            <li><b>A</b>: move the cube to the left</li>
            <li><b>D</b>: move the cube to the right</li>
            <li><b>W</b>: move the cube up</li>
            <li><b>S</b>: move the cube down</li>
            <li><b>Q</b>: move the cube forward</li>
            <li><b>E</b>: move the cube backward</li>
            <li><b>Z</b> and <b>X</b>: rotate cube on the X axis
          </ul>
        </p>

          While at first sight not really impressive, what I found both challenging and fascinating was starting with raw vector and matrix math and using it to project a point, then a line, then a triangle and finally a cube onto the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I got that settled, I started dealing with a simple shading model using directional light. You can see it in action in the way different faces light up when rotating or translating the cube.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challange was texturing the cube. Now, normally this would be something that OpenGL or DirectX would handle. At first I said I would use Canvas to directly access the 2D pixel matrix and scan-fill the corresponding pixels so that I could texture the cube.
          In the end I used some Canvas built-in hack-like functionality to achieve the same result. Not the result I was going for, but it looks ok.
